   <h1>SGPvP Change log</h1>

   <h3>Version 43</h3>
   <p>Released 8 September 2017. Adds boost activations, level 7 armour, and
    minor fixes.</p>

   <h3>Version 42</h3>
   <p>Released 8 March 2017. New actions telerob and buy missile, plus bug
    fixes.</p>

   <h3>Version 41</h3>
   <p>Released 19 Oct 2016. A wide array of new actions, including switching
    combat modes, repair-or-attack keys, timebomb deployment and more.  New
    download and update URLs for Firefox, due to Dropbox policy change.  Source
    code now on Github.</p>

   <h3>Versions 38, 39, 40</h3>
   <p>Undocumented.</p>

    <h3>Version 37.1</h3>
    <p>Released 5 Jun 2015. Fixes bug introduced by
     <a href="https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/2156">Greasemonkey issue #2156</a>
     No changes to Chrome version.</p>

    <h3>Version 37</h3>
    <p>Released 2 Apr 2014. Changes disengage so that, if not blocked,
    only one server request is needed to jump to retreat tile.  Fixes
    fast keypress choking for action "set ambush".  Deals with
    disabled buttons (e.g. cloak when you have no AP) by navving.</p>

    <h3>Version 36</h3>
    <p>Released 1 Apr 2014. Fixes two issues: an apparent freeze when
    the user was hitting keys too fast, and retreat not working
    reliably under partial refresh.</p>

    <h3>Version 35</h3>
    <p>Released 18 Jan 2014. Fixes engage action for non-premium
    accounts.</p>

    <h3>Version 34</h3>
    <p>Released 22nd Sept 2013. This only includes a minor fix to use
    the premium buttons when possible when selecting the number of
    rounds to attack.  This works around an issue where the script
    occasionally fails to select the rounds correctly and fires one
    round.  That issue hasn't been reproducible in development
    environments, so it may be there still, but Premium users should
    not be affected by it now.</p>

    <h3>Version 33</h3>
    <p>Released 10th Sept 2013. This release doesn't add many visible
    new features, but there are major internal changes, hopefully for
    the last time.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The script runs now on the top Pardus frame, rather than the
     main ("nav") frame.  This allows for catching key presses on all
     frames. More importantly, this means the script is injected once
     when you undock, and persists loaded for a long time, rather than
     being parsed and evaluated every time you nav.  This is a big
     performance improvement.</li>
     <li>New import/export keymap feature.</li>
     <li>Better documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 32</h3>
    <p>Released 2nd Sept 2013. This is a major update, featuring:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Configurable key map with pretty user interface &#8212; no
     mucking about in the source code.</li>
     <li>New actions available: engage for fewer rounds, raid.</li>
     <li>User interface code segregated from core and loaded on
     demand, for faster loading (core script size below 30 KB).</li>
     <li>Verified working on Firefox 18 and later.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We started keeping a change log document here. If it's ever
    needed, earlier revision information is available to developers,
    from the git log.</p>
