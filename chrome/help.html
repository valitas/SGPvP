   <h2><a name="quickstart">Quick start</a></h2>

   <p>This extension adds a number of keyboard commands to help in PvP
    combat. In general, it's used as follows:</p>

   <ol>
    <li>
     <p><strong>Configure the extension.</strong></p>

     <p>Press the <em>Configure</em> key to bring up the configuration dialogue
      (on the default keymap this is key <span>I</span>; the rest of this
      section assumes the default keymap is in use). Enter your op QL there,
      your preferred "low armour" threshold (for bot repairs), and your ship's
      maximum armour points and armour strength. Close the dialogue.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p><strong>Test your configuration.</strong></p>

     <p>Press the <em>Test robots</em> key (<span>N</span>). If undocked and
      other ships are present on the tile, press the <em>Test targeting</em> key
      (<span>T</span>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p><strong>Set a retreat tile.</strong></p>

     <p>Move to your retreat tile and press the <em>Set retreat tile</em> key
      (<span>Z</span>) to have the extension "remember" it. The retreat tile can
      be a planet, wormhole, whatever, but it has to be in sight and reachable
      from the tile where PvP will occur.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p><strong>Engage.</strong></p>

     <p>Move to the tile where PvP will occur and press the <em>Engage</em> key
      (<span>X</span>) repeatedly. As soon as a target appears, you will be
      taken to the combat screen. Pressing the <em>Engage</em> key again will
      fire against the target.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <p><strong>Disengage.</strong></p>

     <p>When you have to retreat, press the <em>Disengage</em> key
      (<span>C</span>) repeatedly if needed, until you are back at your retreat
      tile.</p>
    </li>
   </ol>

   <p>There are many additional functions that you can use; see below.</p>

   <h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>

   <h3>Targeting</h3>

   <p>The script requires that you specify which ships on your tile are to be
    attacked, and which are to be excluded from attack.</p>

   <p>The way this is done is by pasting a quick list into the configuration
    dialogue. The script parses the same QL format used for ambushes, and learns
    from it which factions, alliances, and individuals are to be included and
    excluded. Note, however, that friend/foe, bounty, and ship class/size
    criteria in the QL are ignored.</p>

   <p>On top of the QL, the script provides for include and exclude override
    lists. You can specify only pilot names or IDs in these lists, not alliances
    or factions. Pilots excluded this way won't be engaged no matter
    what. Pilots included in this way will not only be engaged, but will also be
    prioritised: of all the ships on your tile, the one listed first on your
    include override list will be targeted.</p>

   <p>When no priority targets are present on the tile, then a target is
    selected based on ship type &#8212; the script attempts to engage traders
    and battleships first, breakers last.  As a last resort, all else being the
    same, the pilot with the lowest ID will be engaged.</p>

   <h3>Keymap</h3>

   <p>In the configuration dialogue, click on <em>Key bindings</em> to view and
    edit the keymap.  You may click on any key to customise its behaviour.  Do
    note that there many available functions not bound to a key by default, so
    explore and suit yourself.</p>

   <p>If you remove the <em>Configure</em> key, or change its binding and later
    forget what you chose, remember that you can always press <span>Esc</span>
    to open the configuration dialogue again.</p>

   <p>Fine-tuning the keymap just the way you want it may be labourious.
    Consider using <em>Import/Export keymap</em> and then saving your keymap to
    a text file, or email it to yourself, whatever.  This way, if you ever have
    to reinstall this script, or use it on a different computer, you can quickly
    restore your keymap by importing it back.  Technically-minded users may also
    use this to define arbitrary keys; see
    <a href="customkeys.html">here</a>.</p>

   <h3>Robots</h3>

   <p>You have to specify your preferred "low armour" threshold, and your ship's
    maximum armour points and installed armour strength (1 through 6).
    Normally, the extension will repair your armour once it goes below the low
    threshold, and will use enough bots to take you to full armour.</p>

   <p>Note that the extension will repair you to full armour even if it has to
    partially waste one robot.  If you'd rather it doesn't waste bots, manually
    configure your maximum armour points to the result of:</p>

   <pre><em>max_ship_armour</em> - (180/<em>armour_strength</em>) + 1</pre>

   <p>(e.g. 445 for a Hawk with level V armour)</p>
