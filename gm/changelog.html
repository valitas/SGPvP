    <h1>SGPvP Change log</h1>

    <h3>Version 35</h3>
    <p>Released 18 Jan 2014. Fixes engage action for non-premium
    accounts.</p>

    <h3>Version 34</h3>
    <p>Released 22nd Sept 2013. This only includes a minor fix to use
    the premium buttons when possible when selecting the number of
    rounds to attack.  This works around a reported issue, where the
    script occasionally fails to select the rounds correctly and fires
    one round.  That issue hasn't been reproducible in development
    environments, so it may be there still, but Premium users should
    not be affected by it now.</p>

    <h3>Version 33</h3>
    <p>Released 10th Sept 2013. This release doesn't add many visible
    new features, but there are major internal changes, hopefully for
    the last time.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The script runs now on the top Pardus frame, rather than the
     main ("nav") frame.  This allows for catching key presses on all
     frames. More importantly, this means the script is injected once
     when you undock, and persists loaded for a long time, rather than
     being parsed and evaluated every time you nav.  This is a big
     performance improvement.</li>
     <li>New import/export keymap feature.</li>
     <li>Better documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 32</h3>
    <p>Released 2nd Sept 2013. This is a major update, featuring:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Configurable key map with pretty user interface &#8212; no
     mucking about in the source code.</li>
     <li>New actions available: engage for fewer rounds, raid.</li>
     <li>User interface code segregated from core and loaded on
     demand, for faster loading (core script size below 30K).</li>
     <li>Primary development moved to Google Chrome, now fully
     functional, releases ported to Firefox from now on.</li>
     <li>Verified working on Firefox 18 and later.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We started keeping a change log document here. If it's ever
    needed, earlier revision information is available to developers,
    from the git log.</p>
